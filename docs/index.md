## Alerts with Amazon EventBridge

**Introduction**
- EventBridge reduces the process of constructing an event-driven platform. EventBridge, decouple the destination from the source of the event, and this way you can refine and publish directly to EventBridge. There is no configuration needed. Improve developer agility as well as application resiliency with decoupled event-based architectures.
- EventBridge bridge applications based on events. An event is an alert that a systemâ€™s state has changed. Customers can set up the own AWS applications with microservices, SaaS applications, and custom applications as event sources that publish events to an event bus. You can state a filtering rule to refine events and target events to AWS services and API destinations (via HTTP endpoint). 
- EventBridge schema registry persist schema produced by your applications, AWS services, or SaaS applications which contains information like the title, format, and validation rules for event data. You can download code bindings for any schema in the registry in your IDE and directly use the strongly-typed object representing the event in your code

**Tutorial**
- This tutorial, will leverage Amazon EventBridge to track and notify when an IAM policy is attached to an IAM user. The EventBridge Rule configured will track for a specific event name in CloudTrail, and will use an SNS message to notify regarding and event, when it occurs.
